Neural networks are very useful as they are good at optimizing. We can solve a multitude of ways in the grid. This could include prioritizing low obstacles over clear ones or vice versa. It could be solved using different given parameters; these could include knowing where the goal is, or just being able to see around the current block. A neural network could optimize for all of these given hyperparameters. It could also be improved by increasing the layers, or neurons, or inputs. Neural networks are also able to be implemented into other problems rather easily than other algorithms where it is designed to tackle a set problem. Neural networks can optimize a lot of stuff that can be fed into it as data.
